CX-App Abstract

This project proposes the development of a decentralized application (CApp)
that functions similarly to a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Built on the
robust Ethereum block-chain, the CApp will leverage the power and security of
Solidity smart contracts. These smart contracts will facilitate secure and
transparent peer-to-peer token swapping functionalities, allowing users to
exchange various cryptocurrencies directly without relying on centralized
intermediaries. This innovative approach goes beyond the limitations of
traditional messaging applications that only permit sending transactions with
GIFs. Software Requirements
